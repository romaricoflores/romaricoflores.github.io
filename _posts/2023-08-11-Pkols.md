Introduction:
Creating a 3D digital elevation model (DEM) of a real-world location can provide valuable insights and visualizations for various purposes, from urban planning to environmental analysis. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of creating a 3D DEM of Mount Douglas in Saanich, British Columbia, Canada, using the ArcGIS Pro Global Scene Editor. This powerful tool allows you to visualize and analyze geographic data in a three-dimensional space, providing a detailed representation of the terrain.

**Prerequisites:**
- ArcGIS Pro installed on your computer
- Access to elevation data (Digital Elevation Model or LiDAR data) for Mount Douglas
- Basic familiarity with ArcGIS Pro and its interface

**Step 1: Import Elevation Data:**
1. Open ArcGIS Pro and create a new project.
2. Add your elevation data.

**Step 2: Create a New Global Scene:**
1. From the "Insert" tab, select "New Map" and choose "Global Scene."
2. Set the coordinate system and map extent to match your elevation data.

**Step 3: Add Elevation Data to the Scene:**
1. In the "Contents" pane, right-click on "Scene Layers" and select "Add Data."
2. Choose the elevation data you imported in Step 1 and add it to the global scene.

**Step 4: Adjust Elevation Surface Settings:**
1. Select the elevation layer in the "Contents" pane.
2. In the "Appearance" tab, adjust the elevation surface settings such as Minimum and Maximum values to accurately represent the terrain of Mount Douglas.

**Step 5: Add Imagery:**
1. To enhance the visualization, add imagery by clicking on the "Insert" tab and selecting "New Basemap Layer." Choose an appropriate basemap for your project.

**Step 6: Navigate and Explore:**
1. Use the navigation tools (pan, zoom, rotate) in the Global Scene Editor to explore the 3D terrain of Mount Douglas.
2. Adjust the vertical exaggeration if necessary to emphasize the elevation differences.

**Step 7: Add Additional Data (Optional):**
1. You can enhance your 3D scene by adding additional data layers, such as roads, water bodies, vegetation, and buildings. This will provide context and depth to your model.

**Step 8: Customize Appearance (Optional):**
1. Experiment with different rendering and visualization options to highlight specific features or aspects of the terrain.

**Step 9: Analyze and Interpret:**
1. Utilize the analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro to perform various tasks, such as line of sight analysis, slope analysis, or viewshed analysis, to gain insights into the terrain's characteristics.

**Step 10: Save and Share:**
1. Once you're satisfied with your 3D DEM, save your project.
2. You can share your project with others by creating a web scene or exporting images and videos of your 3D model.

Conclusion:
Creating a 3D digital elevation model of Mount Douglas in Saanich, BC using ArcGIS Pro Global Scene Editor allows you to visualize and analyze the terrain in a dynamic and insightful way. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can create a detailed and accurate representation of the landscape, providing valuable information for various applications.
